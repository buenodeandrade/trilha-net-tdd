www.dio.me

## Project Challenge
For this challenge, you will need to use the knowledge acquired in the Working with Test-Driven Development module of the DIO .NET track.

## Context
Your task involves creating a console-based calculator application with comprehensive testing following the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

This calculator should support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

You are expected to write unit tests for each operation before implementing the corresponding functionality in your calculator application.

The main class of your calculator application should include the following functionalities:
- Support for integer number calculations exclusively.
- Robust exception handling for division by zero scenarios.
- Display a history of the last three operations performed.
